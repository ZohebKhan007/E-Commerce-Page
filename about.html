                                Harvey Specter is a person who gets stuff done efficently and effectively. "Work until you 
                                no longer have to introduce yourself." His outlook on how to get work done and his wisdom 
                                supercedes that of an old monk. His associate has photographic memory and has memorized the 
                                law from end to end, and is still basically a baby compared to Harvey. He is an inspiration
                                to people without superhuman abilities, that consistent hardwork and dedication to his craft
                                is what made a him a force to be reckoned with. His insight to the financial side of a business
                                is what really stands out about him. He has saved multiple companies from bankruptcy and has 
                                risen start-up companies sky-high. Oh, and one of his clients include Michael Jordan.

                                around him. But it is this attribute that gives him a new edge along with the ability 
                                to see things at a new light, thus allowing him to come up with unique, exotic, and 
                                extravagent maneuvers to promote this company. His angelic side allows to feel peoples 
                                desires and his devilish side allows him to understand and manipulate these desires to 
                                help excel this company to new heights
